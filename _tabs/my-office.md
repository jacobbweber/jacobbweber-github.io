## Homelabs

Since I have already invested pretty heavily into my Gaming PC. I typically use it to host my lab environments using either Hyper-v or VMware Workstation Pro and GNS3 for virtual networking. There are some great tutorials out there for using Ansible+GNS3 to simulate managing routers/switch's via code. I don't have long running workloads that require constant uptime, so I spin up/down environments as needed. For hybrid learning, I extend my local labs into cloud hosting platforms like Azure and AWS when I have trial/credits available.

Future state, I have considered buying some "Mini PC"s like Intels NUC 12 pro or Asus Expertcenter PN52. The thought was to get 2-4 of them that run ESXi/vSphere  but haven't had a huge need to do it yet.

One of my goals this year (2024) is to put together some labs using automation and all the BuzzOps. The first project I'm going to tackle is located here [homelab-hyperv](https://github.com/jacobbweber/homelab-hyperv), where I plan to use tools like HashiCorp packer/terraform and ansible to spin up a windows domain based lab with linux realm joined servers. The goal is to be able to spin up the environment and run various playbooks for configuring everything + install other apps like Grafana/Prometheus for monitoring.

From there I can more easily tackle learning new topics of interest more easily having the infrastructure available.
