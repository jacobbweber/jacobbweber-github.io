![myphoto](about-me.jpg)

I'm Jacob Weber, a Systems Engineer with 10+ years experience and a solid background in managing infrastructure systems. My experience spans across sectors like Higher Education, Banking/Finance, and Insurance. As a kid, I was more into outdoor activities than technology. However, PC video games eventually sparked my interest in tech. I recall a friend who was an avid gamer. We faced challenges playing together due to distance and the limitations of multiplayer gaming at that time. Our first joint game was "Diablo", where we used a (mysterious at the time) "TCP/IP" option in the game menu, which tied up the phone line for hours due to dial-up internet. This experience fascinated me, especially how we could interact in the game despite the physical distance.

During my last two years of high school, I studied "Computer and Information Science" at a vocational school. We covered the basics of computers, including their components and functions. By the end of the first year, we had to build our own computers for use in the second year. The program included work-study placements where we gained real-world experience. After high school, instead of pursuing a traditional college degree, I enrolled in a four-year trade program called "Office Automation." The course covered various topics, such as basic electronics, telecommunications, and copier repair, alongside web development and IT certifications like CompTia A+, Network +, and Security +. This training provided a strong foundation for my career in technology, even though I missed out on the traditional college experience and don't have a degree, which is often not a requirement in the tech industry.

In my career, continuous learning has been essential. Balancing work, personal life, and self education can be challenging due to the rapid advancement of technology and I want to learn it all. I've been seeking an effective way to document and share what I've learned and worked on. While not skilled in blogging or technical writing, I've been inspired by others' personal websites and articles that have aided me. So, I decided to create my own website to potentially assist others on their tech journeys.

When I am not living in the Tech world I enjoy outdoors and do a little homesteading!

Here is a timelapse video of me making a Chicken Tractor. It is essentially a chicken coop on wheels!
